# Power BI Project : CUSTOMER ANALYTICS - RFM CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
Unlock the power of Power BI with this in-depth Customer Analytics Dashboard tutorial! Learn how to analyze sales data and segment customers using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis to identify high-value customers and improve marketing strategies.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to apply RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This segmentation enables businesses to design targeted marketing strategies, enhance customer retention, and maximize revenue growth.

## 📂 Dataset
- <a href= "https://github.com/TrieuTuanVi/RFM-CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION/blob/main/AdventureWorksDW.XLSX">Dataset</a>
* Customer transactional dataset including: Customer ID, Full Name, Email Address, Marital Status, Age, Country,...
* Cleaned and pre-processed to ensure accuracy for RFM calculation.

## 🛠️Tools & Technologies Used
 
 * **Microsoft Power BI** — Used for building dynamic dashboards and visual storytelling.

 * **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** — Applied for advanced calculations and custom metrics inside Power BI.

 * **Power Query Editor** — Used for data transformation, merging, and reshaping.

 


## ⚙️ Data Processing Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** 

2. **RFM Score Calculation**: Use DAX Measures for dynamic calculations.

  * **Recency**: Days since last purchase.

  * **Frequency**: Total number of purchases.

  * **Monetary**: Total amount spent.

3. **Customer Segmentation**: Classify customers into 12 segments based on RFM scores.

4. **Visualization**: Build interactive Power BI dashboards for clear business insights.

 ## 💡 Project Insights
 
* **Champions** and **Loyal customers** contribute the largest share of total sales.

* Customers aged **55-74 years** are the most profitable demographic.

* The **North America** and **Europe** regions generate the highest revenue.

* Segments like **Potential Loyalist** and **Promising** show _high potential_ but are _under-engaged_.

* **At Risk** and **Need Attention** groups show early signs of churn and require proactive marketing efforts.

## ✅ Final Conclusion

The analysis highlights that a large portion of customers are at risk or require attention, while only a small percentage fall into the loyal or champion segments. To improve customer retention and revenue, businesses should implement personalized engagement strategies for “At Risk” and “Need Attention” groups, while maintaining exclusive rewards and loyalty programs to retain “Champions” and encourage “Promising” customers to evolve into long-term loyal buyers.
